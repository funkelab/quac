## Overview
QuAC is a tool for understanding the sometimes subtle differences between classes of images, by questioning a classifier's decisions.
The method generates counterfactual images: making slight changes in an image to change its clasification.
The counterfactuals in QuAC have localized changes, and are quantitatively scored to determine how well they describe the classifier's decision.
