# Get started

So you've decided to use QuAC...
Great! In this how-to we'll describe the full QuAC pipeline, from installation to visualizing results.

There is a directory called `example_experiment` in the QuAC repository, which you can copy and rename to your purposes. 
It will hold the configuration file and scripts which we will use later on.
