# So you've decided to use QuAC...

Great! In this how-to we'll go through the process of setting up QuAC for your images.
We built QuAC with biological images in mind, so those will be our analogies here. However, you're very welcome to use QuAC with any kind of image data!
If you're interested in using it with non-image data, please [contact us](mailto:adjavond%40hhmi.org?subject=QuAC%20Help)
